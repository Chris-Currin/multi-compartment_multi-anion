Thanks to Kira Dusterwald's modelling and mathematical prowess, there is a single compartment model of a neuron with anion (impermeable and chloride) dynamics and volume control.

This shall be extended to a multi-compartmental model, and visualised using OpenGL. Hopefully computational work can be complemented by experimental data from Dr. Joseph Raimondo.

# Task list (updated 20 Sept)

## Whoever gets there first
* Check that diffusion of all ions works (2 compartment)
* Diffusion constants for Na, K, Cl (see equation_flow.pdf)
* Diffusion with different pump rates in adjacent compartments

## Kira
* Find good pump rate value
* Implement anion flux in one compartment

## Joe
* Experimental work

## Chris
* OpenGL

## General

# Timeline
* Finish: Dec 2016
