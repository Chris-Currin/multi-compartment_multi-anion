Thanks to Kira Dusterwald's modelling and mathematical prowess, there is a single compartment model of a neuron with anion (impermeable and chloride) dynamics and volume control.

This shall be extended to a multi-compartmental model, and visualised using OpenGL. Hopefully computational work can be complemented by experimental data from Dr. Joseph Raimondo.

# Task list (updated 4 Dec)
* mechanisms
* anion flux between compartments (rate?)
* useful:
    * plot expressions
    * explore changing Ar
