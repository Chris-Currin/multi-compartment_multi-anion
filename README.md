# Multi-Compartment Multi-Anion
Multi compartmental model of a neuron with multiple ion species, including chloride and impermeable anions.

Thanks to Kira Dusterwald's modelling and mathematical prowess, there is a single compartment model of a neuron with anion (impermeable and chloride) dynamics and volume control.

This shall be extended to a multi-compartmental model, and visualised using OpenGL. Hopefully computational work can be complemented by experimental data from Dr. Joseph Raimondo.

# Task list (updated 20 Oct)
* why depolarise when pKCC2 or anions altered in one compartment?
    * Plot `j_net` of diffusion 
* scale down neuron (20 um length, 3 um radius)
* anion flux between compartments (rate?)
* useful:
    * plot expressions
    * explore changing Ar
