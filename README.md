Thanks to Kira Dusterwalt's modelling and mathematical prowess, there is a single compartment model of a neuron with anion (impermeable and chloride) dynamics and volume control.

This shall be extended to a multi-compartmental model, and visualised using OpenGL. Hopefully computational work can be complemented by experimental data from Dr. Joseph Raimondo.

# Task list

## Kira
* Transpile MATLAB code to Python
* Write up equation usage within code

## Joe
* Experimental work

## Chris
* OpenGL
* Connect the compartments using Fick's law and Nernst equation OR Nersnt-Planck equation
* Grow compartments (length)

## General
* Timestep?

# Timeline
* Finish: Dec 2016
